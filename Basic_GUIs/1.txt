A record-shattering batting performance backed up equally outstanding bowling by the Bhuvneshwar Kumar-led seam-bowling unit has helped Team India win the final T20I by 36 runs and register their third consecutive T20I series win against England .Chasing 225, England may have lost Jason Roy on the second ball of their innings but Dawid Malan and Jos Buttler ensured that the visitors got off to a rollicking start.Malan, who has struggled throughout the series, laid into Indian seamers, especially Hardik Pandya, who went for 18 in his first over.Malan raced his way to 33 off just 20 balls while Jos Buttler, courtesy back-to-back boundaries off Washington Sundar and a six off Shardul Thakur, stroked 14-ball 23 as England racked up 62 runs in the powerplay.Malan completed his half-century with a glance past fine-leg in the next over and he celebrated that with an audacious six over the cover-region and then a drive for a boundary. Buttler too completed his fifty in the next over as England racing their way to 1/127 in 12 overs.
